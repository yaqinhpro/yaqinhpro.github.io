Hi, I am Yaqin Huang, currently looking for a full-time Software Engineer position. I was an eDrawings R&D Development Engineer at Solidworks Corp for two years. I am specialized in HoloLens 2 and HoloLens 1 app development with Unity 3D engine and Unity Mixed Reality Toolkit or C++ OpenGL based Render System. During my time in eDrawings, We have built HoloLens 2 and 1 MR (Mixed Reality) CAD Model viewer apps and HoloLens 1 MR streaming solution. I worked very closely with our UX designers and we filed a US patent “Systems and Methods for Mating Virtual Objects to Real-World Environments” in February 2019. I also have experience with C++ Windows Application Development and OpenGL based Graphic Rendering Development.

I got my master of science degree in Electrical and Computer engineering at Boston University in 2018 and bachelor of science degree in Electrical Engineering at Purdue University in 2016. During the study at BU, I used to be a collaborator in MIT Media Lab Fluid Interface Group doing Virtual Reality Research with Ph.D. Judith Amores. In 2017, I won the second prize in Virtual 2 Reality Challenge powered by Discover and was invited to Innovation Project Conference. In 2016, I also won the Hackers’ choice award in the MIT Media Lab Hacking Arts Hackathon.

I love engineering and science, especially building products like HCI devices that will gradually become more important in our lives as we move forward.

Although software engineer is my job, I always try to fill my world with not only logic and numbers, but also sensibility and humanities. A great product should take both technology and humanities into consideration. We should always remember that technological advancement is more about humans, not technology itself.

Exploring new ideas, new technologies, and new products always motivate me. I have experience both with fast prototyping, fast iteration, and solid software development cycle.

My current interests include Virtual Reality/Mixed Reality/Augmented Reality. If you are interested in my work and want to know more, please go to [Portfolio](https://yaqinhpro.github.io/archives/) page.
