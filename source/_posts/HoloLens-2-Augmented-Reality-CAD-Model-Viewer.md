As the update version of HoloLens 1, HoloLens 2 has great improvements including better processing power, larger field of view, more detailed hand tracking ability, better comfortability, eye-tracking ability, etc.  We partner with Microsoft to develop our CAD Model viewer app on the latest Mixed Reality platform to enhance our app by integrating unique HoloLens 2 features into our app.

We mainly use the Unity 3D engine, Unity assets, and the MRTKV2 to build our app. Similar to our HoloLens 1 app, our HoloLens2 app could load model(s), reset, drag, rotate, scale and mate model. We integrate all the new HoloLens 2 and MRTKV2 features into our app so our app is more intuitive and easier to use with new hand gestures, better software and hardware performance of HoloLens 2 and updated Unity assets.

Due to Microsoft policy, we could not expose any photo or video of the actual HoloLens 2 device so there is only world description for now. But if you are interested in Hololens 2, there are some official videos and articles that I recommend and you could take a look:
